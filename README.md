# CRUD_SQlite_Database

### INTRODUCTION

This Flutter application is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app that allows users to manage local data using SQLite. The application is designed to manage basic user data including a name, email, title, and description. The app utilizes SQLite for local storage of the data, making it fully functional without requiring an internet connection. The app is built with Flutter and leverages various Flutter widgets to provide a clean and intuitive UI for user interaction.

### FEATURES

**Add Data**: Users can input their data (name, email, title, description) and save it to the local SQLite database.

**Edit Data**: Users can select an existing entry to update its details.
**Delete Data**: Users can delete any entry from the database.
**SQLite Database**: All user data is stored in a local SQLite database for persistence.
**Responsive UI**: The UI is designed to be user-friendly, with cards showing data in a list and providing easy access to add, edit, or delete entries.
